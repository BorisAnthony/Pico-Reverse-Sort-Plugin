Pico Reverse Sort
==============

By default pico sorts menu items alphanumerically. This plugin flips the sort.
Useful if, for example, you save your .md files in a dated space (i.e.: 2015/10/12/todays_deep_thought.md) and want the index page to list reverse-chronologcially, like a "weblog"â€¦

Installation
------------

1. Copy `pico_reverse_sort.php` into the plugins folder.
2. ???
3. Profit!

```
